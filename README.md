## ðŸ“Š Workflow

1. **Dataset Preparation:**  
   - Collect or use a public dataset of hand gesture images.  
   - Organize data into labeled folders for each gesture class.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Resize images to a uniform size (e.g., 128x128 or 224x224).  
   - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].  
   - Apply data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping).  

3. **Model Building:**  
   - Design a CNN architecture or use transfer learning (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet).  
   - Use appropriate activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions for classification.  

4. **Model Training:**  
   - Train the model on the preprocessed dataset and validate it on a separate set.  
   - Monitor training performance with metrics like accuracy and loss.  

5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Test the model on unseen data and calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.  
   - Visualize confusion matrices and other evaluation plots.  

6. **Deployment:**  
   - Build a user interface to upload images or use real-time webcam input for predictions.
